# This is my project for ETH + AVAX Proof: Intermediate course module 2 by Metacrafters.

- I have created a simple contract with some functions and then shown the values of those functions in frontend of the application which I got from the starter template provided by the Metacrafters.
- I have made some modifications in the index.js file of the starter template and added my solidity code.
